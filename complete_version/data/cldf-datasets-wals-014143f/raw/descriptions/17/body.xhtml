<a name="1.The_separation_of_primary_and_secondary_stress"></a>1.The separation of primary and secondary stress</h2>
<p class="Textbody">Assuming that the phonemes that make up words are organized into syllables, modern linguistic theory claims that <b>rhythm</b> is a manifestation of the fact that syllables are further grouped into constituents called <b>feet</b>, which are usually binary groupings of syllables. Standard Metrical Theory takes the grouping of syllables into feet as fundamental for the assignment of bounded primary stress. StressTyp is based on a separation of the treatment of <b>primary</b> and <b>secondary stress</b>. Such a separation has been proposed and defended on theoretical grounds by <a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/van-der-Hulst-1996" title="view reference details">van der Hulst (1996)</a>. We offer several arguments here.</p>
<p class="Firstlineindent">First, in our discussion of bounded systems (Chapter <a class="Feature" href="http://wals.info/chapter/15#section2.1.">15, §2.1</a>) we have seen that weight-sensitive primary stress locations within the two-syllable window can take four different forms (at each edge of the word). <b>Rhythm types</b>, however, fall into just two categories, due to the fact that a rhythmic foot cannot contain two heavy syllables (because every heavy syllable constitutes a rhythmic beat). This difference, then, may make it necessary to describe primary and secondary stress patterns separately.</p>
<p class="Firstlineindent">A second argument for the separation can be found in systems in which secondary stress starts at the edge that is opposite to the location of primary stress; we refer to such systems as <i>polar</i>. An example is given in (1).</p>

<p class="Textbody">In total, 39 languages (8% of all the languages in StressTyp) assign main and secondary stress from opposite directions. It would seem that the subset of languages for which we need separate direction parameters for main stress and rhythm is large enough to provide serious support for the separation of primary and secondary stress. </p>
<p class="Firstlineindent">A third argument for the separation of primary and secondary stress is formed by languages in which the rules for main stress and rhythm do not agree in their usage of weight, or more intricately, in the way in which they use it. In <a class="Language" href="http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_kay" title="view language details">Kayardild</a>, for instance, main stress is initial, regardless of weight, but long vowels receive a secondary stress, whereas short vowels do not (simplified for expositional purposes). </p>

<p class="Textbody">In total, we need separate quantity statements for primary and secondary stress in 57 languages (11% of all the languages in StressTyp). All in all 17% of the languages in StressTyp support the separation hypothesis (Tables 1 and 2 combined, 10 overlapping languages).</p>
<p class="Firstlineindent">A fourth argument for separating primary and secondary stress assignment lies in the fact that whereas lexical marking is quite normal for primary stress, even in systems that have dominant rule-governed locations, secondary stresses are never a matter of lexical marking. In this statement, we ignore so-called “cyclic stresses”, i.e. secondary stresses that correspond to primary stress locations in embedded morphemes in complex words.</p>

<h3 class="heading-2">
<a name="section2.1."></a>2.1. Trochaic rhythm</h3>
<p class="Textbody">The prototypical rhythm pattern stresses every odd syllable from the left in languages with initial main stress, and every even syllable from the right in languages with penultimate main stress. This is achieved with trochaic feet, as in <a class="Language" href="http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_ono" title="view language details">Ono</a> (<a class="Family" href="http://wals.info/languoid/family/transnewguinea" title="Trans-New Guinea">Trans-New Guinea</a>; <a class="Country" href="http://wals.info/country/PG" title="view languages for country">Papua New Guinea</a>): <i>(ˈmesi)(ˌkene)</i> ‘you will sit’, <i>(ˈari)(ˌmage)(ˌake)</i> ‘he always goes’.</p>
<h3 class="heading-2">
<a name="section2.2."></a>2.2. Iambic rhythm</h3>
<p class="Textbody">Languages with iambic rhythm typically stress even syllables from the left or odd syllables from the right, as in <a class="Language" href="http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_map" title="view language details">Mapudungun</a> (<a class="Family" href="http://wals.info/languoid/family/araucanian" title="Araucanian">Araucanian</a>; <a class="Country" href="http://wals.info/country/CL" title="view languages for country">Chile</a>): <i>(eˈlu)(muˌyu)</i> ‘give us’, <i>(kiˈmu)(faˌlu)(wuˌlay)</i> ‘he pretended not to know’.</p>
<h3 class="heading-2">
<a name="section2.3."></a>2.3. Dual rhythm</h3>
<p class="Textbody">This type is difficult to find. One needs to look at all the data of a language carefully to discover that one foot type is not sufficient to cover all cases. An example of such a language is <a class="Language" href="http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_yuw" title="view language details">Yuwaalaraay</a> (<a class="Genus" href="http://wals.info/family/australian#pamanyungan" title="Pama-Nyungan">Pama-Nyungan</a>; New South Wales, <a class="Country" href="http://wals.info/country/AU" title="view languages for country">Australia</a>): <i>(gaˌlu)(maˈya)</i> ‘grandson’, <i>(ˈgidul)(ˌgara)</i> ‘snail’.</p>
<h3 class="heading-2">
<a name="section2.4."></a>2.4. Undetermined rhythm</h3>
<p class="Textbody">These languages do have secondary stresses, but the patterning is totally unclear. Languages like <a class="Language" href="http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_mym" title="view language details">Malayalam</a> (<a class="Family" href="http://wals.info/languoid/family/dravidian" title="Dravidian">Dravidian</a>; <a class="Country" href="http://wals.info/country/IN" title="view languages for country">India</a>) which place secondary stress on long vowels only fall under this type: <i>ˈpukavaɳʈi</i> ‘train’, <i>ˈmutaˌlaaɭi</i> ‘boss’.</p>
<h3 class="heading-2">
<a name="section2.5."></a>2.5. No rhythm</h3>
<p class="Textbody">Languages that have main stress but no rhythm abound. An example is <a class="Language" href="http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_gor" title="view language details">Gorowa</a> (<a class="Genus" href="http://wals.info/family/afroasiatic#southerncushitic" title="Southern Cushitic">Southern Cushitic</a>; <a class="Country" href="http://wals.info/country/TZ" title="view languages for country">Tanzania</a>): <i>giramˈbooda</i> ‘snuff’, <i>oroˈmila</i> ‘because’. It remains an open question whether the “no rhythm” languages do have a foot type grouping but lack a clear phonetic manifestation of this grouping; in some cases such "silent" grouping can be detected because it conditions other aspects of the phonology of a language.</p>
<h2 class="heading-1">
<a name="3._Geographical_distribution"></a>3. Geographical distribution </h2>
<p class="Textbody">We observe the following tendencies: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="Standard">Iambic rhythm occurs mostly in North and South America. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="Standard">South America and Australia always seem to have clear rhythmic patterns. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="Standard">Africa, on the other hand, shows little evidence for rhythmic patterns. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="Firstlineindent">As was noted in Chapter <a class="Feature" href="http://wals.info/chapter/14">14</a>, we find an unequal division of languages over the two foot types that we use to describe the rhythmic properties of stress systems. In general, languages prefer the trochaic foot over the iambic foot. Note again that we divide languages into trochaic or iambic systems on the basis of their <i>secondary stress</i> properties. Unfortunately, that means that many languages in StressTyp are left out of the equation, simply because we do not have any secondary stress data for these languages. Statistics for the languages for which we do know something about secondary stress can be found in figure 1.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="figure" src="http://wals.info/static/descriptions/17/images/fig1.png"/>
<figcaption><b>Figure 1</b>: Rhythm types</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="Textbody">The hugely skewed distribution between trochaic and iambic systems in Figure 1 is hard to miss even in a cursory look at the typology of stress systems. Though it has never been quantified in this way before, the scarcity of iambic systems has already led some researchers on the path to total denial of the iamb’s existence as an abstract metrical entity. <a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/Hayes-1995" title="view reference details">Hayes (1995)</a> dispenses with all quantity-insensitive iambs, while among the most drastic of these studies, <a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/van-de-Vijver-1998" title="view reference details">van de Vijver (1998)</a> claims that <i>all</i> iambic systems can be reanalysed as trochaic ones (cf. <a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/van-der-Hulst-1999b" title="view reference details">van der Hulst 1999b</a> for discussion). In StressTyp we choose no sides in this obviously highly theoretical debate. We will continue to offer the iambic foot as an option, because there are enough languages, in our view, whose stress patterns are clearly more straightforwardly described with the help of these iambic feet.</p>

<h3 class="heading-2">
<a name="section4.1."></a>4.1. Correlations between rhythm type and edge</h3>
<p class="Textbody">A correlation that has been noted many times in the past concerns the foot type used in secondary stress assignment and the edge at which this assignment starts. The claim is that languages with an iambic rhythmical pattern assign rhythm from left-to-right, as in <a class="Language" href="http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_map" title="view language details">Mapudungun</a> in <a href="#section2.2.">§2.2</a> (cf. <a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/Kager-1993" title="view reference details">Kager 1993)</a>. An example that makes this clear is given in (3). </p>
<blockquote class="example"><p class="example-start">(3) <a class="Language" href="http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_map" title="view language details">Mapudungun</a> </p>

</div>
<p class="example-end"></p></blockquote>
<p class="Textbody">Rhythm assignment from right-to-left would have given us <i>eluˈaeˌnew</i>. (In this example we note that a left-over syllable, here on the right side, is not footed and hence has no rhythmic beat; this is a quite common phenomenon, and it has been argued that “degenerate”, i.e. monosyllabic, feet are uncommon or universally banned in quantity-insensitive languages.)</p>
<p class="Firstlineindent">The reverse claim, that languages with trochaic rhythm start footing at the right edge, is not commonly deduced from the observation with respect to iambic languages. Linguists seem hesitant to claim anything in this case. So, we present the data for both types in Table 3.</p>

</div>
<p class="Textbody">We observe that the correlation between iambic rhythm and left-to-right footing is indeed quite high. It turns out to be even higher when we remove some "suspicious" cases from the list of right-to-left iambic languages. It appears that in many of these languages the choice between iambic and trochaic feet is not easily made, and where the descriptive source mentions that the language is iambic, this choice is often based on superficial evidence. For only 3 of these cases can we be quite certain that rhythm is iambic.</p>
<p class="Firstlineindent">For trochaic patterns, we note that most trochaic languages start foot assignment at the left instead of the right edge. Yet, the difference is not large enough to speak of a clear correlation in this case. We may conclude, therefore, that the choice to state a correlation between foot type and direction for iambic systems is justified only in hindsight, by the StressTyp data. </p>
<h3 class="heading-2">
<a name="section4.2."></a>4.2. Correlation between rhythm type and relevance of weight</h3>
<p class="Textbody"><a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/Hayes-1995" title="view reference details">Hayes (1995)</a> suggests another correlation, this time between rhythm type and weight-sensitivity, the so-called <b>iambic-trochaic law</b>. According to this “law” weight-insensitive languages (grouping units of equal weight, so to speak) are (preferred to be) trochaic. The reverse claim, that weight-sensitivity leads to iambic grouping, is less obvious, although one idea is that weight-differences based on quantity favor iambic patterns, while weight differences based on “intensity” favor trochaic patterns. However, it is not clear what intensity is (prominence?); moreover, many weight-sensitive trochaic patterns are based on quantity (cf. <a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/Rice-1992" title="view reference details">Rice 1992</a>, <a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/Kager-1993" title="view reference details">Kager 1993</a> and <a class="Reference" href="http://wals.info/refdb/record/van-der-Hulst-1999b" title="view reference details">van der Hulst 1999b</a> for discussion).

<p class="Textbody">The precise grouping of syllables into feet is subject to theoretical discussion.
